# Abstract Play Front-End Client (SvelteKit Rewrite)

This is an in-progress repo. This is intended for local testing only! To test locally, clone, run `npm i`, and then `npm run dev`.

## Goals

-   Move to TypeScript for better maintainability.
-   Abandon React's byzantine toolchain and move to [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/).
-   Begin moving to the [revised Frontend-Gameslib API contract](https://abstractplay.com/wiki/doku.php?id=rfcs:api:frontgames).

## Status

-   [x] Routing
-   [x] i18n
-   [x] Layout and CSS styling
-   [ ] State management: Basics work as expected, but still more to do
-   [ ] Game play page
